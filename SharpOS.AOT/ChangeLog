	* X86/Assembly.cs: more verbose information for multiple label
	definition exception
	* IR/Engine.cs: changed FixupADCMethod to return a new MethodReference
	instead of changing the DeclaringType value of the existing
	MethodReference. This stops the multiple definition problem as it
	seems the same reference instance is used to define the label of the
	method later in the AOT process.
	* IR/Block.cs: replaces the MethodReference used to translate the
	CIL to IR instead of changing the CIL opcode after the fact. This was
	an oversight on my part earlier.

2007-07-18  William Lahti <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* X86/AssemblyMethod.cs: Added support for using variables for the
	size of a 'stackalloc' operation, as opposed to constants. Now this
	works:

	int count = 4;
	int *array = stackalloc int [count];

2007-07-17  William Lahti <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* IR/Engine.cs: Added SetStatusInformation and ClearStatusInformation
	which can be used from other phases of compilation to set the current
	method being compiled.
	* Program.cs: status information is now shown at any stage of
	compilation as long as the current method is not null.
	* X86/Assembly.cs: use SetStatusInformation to provide status during
	assembly encoding phase

	* IR/Engine.cs: Engine.GetInternalType(): gave 'void' a specific case
	and added a warning if no specific case is found
	* Changelog: wrapping

2007-06-18  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* Added better error handling, the AOT tells you what method it was in
	when it crashed :)
	* The program wrapping SharpOS.AOT.IR.Engine can pull some status
	information from the Engine instance in the case of an exception.

2007-05-14  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* SharpOS.AOT.build: added missing delete directives in `clean' target.
	* X86/Assembly.cs: Added CRType register size to GetSizeType

2007-05-10  Bruce Markham  <illuminus86@gmail.com>
	* IR/Operands/MethodReference.cs: new class to represent a 
	Mono.Cecil.MethodReference for use in 'Assign' type IR instructions
	* IR/Block.cs: added a handler for OpCodes.Ldftn in method
	ConvertFromCIL(), also fixed ambiguous type reference between
	Mono.Cecil.MethodReference and IR.Operands.MethodReference
	* IR/Engine.cs: fixed ambiguous type reference between
	Mono.Cecil.MethodReference and IR.Operands.MethodReference
	* IR/Method.cs: fixed ambiguous type reference between
	Mono.Cecil.MethodReference and IR.Operands.MethodReference
	* IR/Operands/Call.cs:  fixed ambiguous type reference between
	Mono.Cecil.MethodReference and IR.Operands.MethodReference

2007-05-07  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* fixed clobbering of assembly dump
	* Program.cs: fixed missing argument for 'file not found' error
	* Program.cs: fixed handling of output filename options

2007-05-06  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* more documentation
	* IR/Engine.cs: Added better compatibility checking for ADC stub fixups,
	support for nested namespaces in ADC.
	* IR/EngineOptions.cs: moved class from IR/Engine.cs
	* IR/EngineException.cs: moved class from IR/EngineException.cs
	* Attributes/ADCLayerAttribute.cs: moved from ADCAttributes.cs
	* Attributes/ADCInterfaceAttribute.cs: new attribute to allow nested
	namespaces in the ADC interface/layers.
	* Attributes/ADCStubAttribute.cs: moved from ADCAttributes.cs
	
2007-05-06  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* IR/Instructions/Instructions.cs: uses new DumpProcessor constructor
	* IR/Engine.cs: modified to pass console dump options to DumpProcessor
	* IR/Dump.cs: modified to allow real-time output of dump information, as
	opposed to dumping at the very end of the AOT.
	* IR/Block.cs: uses new DumpProcessor constructor
	* Program.cs: now supports -console-dump option
	
2007-05-01  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>
	* IR/Engine.cs: refactoring, added support for automatically ignoring 
	classes from ADC implementation namespaces (that is, those specified by 
	ADCLayerAttributes on the assembly).
	* IR/Block.cs: added support for automatic fixup of calls to methods 
	marked with ADCStubAttribute to the correct ADC layer implementation 
	as selected by the current CPU type.
	* Program.cs: added support for generation of bootable floppy images.
	* Attributes/ADCAttributes.cs: ADCLayerAttribute, ADCStubAttribute are 
	used to control the AOT's architecture-dependent code mechanisms.
	* Attributes/StringAttribute.cs: added documentation
	* Resources/ImageBuilder.sh: A floppy image generator for UNIX/Linux.
	* Resources/ImageBuilder.bat: A floppy image generator for Microsoft 
	Windows.
	* SharpOS.AOT.build: added resources to build file
	* ChangeLog: added a top-level ChangeLog.

2007-04-29  William Lahti  <xfurious@gmail.com>

	* added option support
	* added multiple-DLL compilation support
	* split the AOT into SharpOS.AOT.Core.dll and SharpOS.AOT.exe.
	* added XML/new text format dumping
	* IR/Method.cs: changed Method.LiveRange, Method.DefUseItem to public.
	changed Method.Dump() to Method.DumpBlocks().
	* Instructions/*.cs: removed Dump() overrides for the Pop, Return, and 
	Switch instructions.
	* added some FIXMEs for incorrect/foggy documentation
	* IR/Engine.cs: added EngineVersion, value is 'svn' (should match release).
	* various minor refactoring
	* changed build file to allow command line definition of 'debug' property
	* changed build file to include "Attributes/*.cs" sources.
